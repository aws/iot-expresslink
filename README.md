## AWS IoT ExpressLink

Watch [this overview presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6K9knXZpC8A) to get a better understanding of what AWS IoT ExpressLink provides.

This repository contains examples for integrating an AWS IoT ExpressLink module into an application.  These examples are intended to demonstrate how to perform the common operations for an IoT device.

The AWS IoT ExpressLink AT command specification can be found in the [Programmer's Manual](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-expresslink).

Information about AWS IoT ExpressLink and partner's hardware modules can be found at AWS Partner Network's Device Catalog from the [main page](https://aws.amazon.com/iot-expresslink). Module datasheet, Getting Started Guide, and Product Information are also included in the device catalog.

## Prototyping SDK libraries
### C libraries
ExpressLink drivers and examples written in C for different MCU platforms.
#### STM32
CMSIS pack for ExpressLink driver and examples, integrated with STM32CubeMX, the native configuration and code generation tool from STMicroelectronics.
The combination enables developers to quickly and easily create applications that connect to AWS IoT Core using ExpressLink modules with various STM32 MCUs.

## Hands-On Workshops and Resources

The **AWS IoT ExpressLink Demo Badge Workshop** is available at https://catalog.workshops.aws/aws-iot-expresslink-demo-badge/. This workshop ran as *IOT207-R* on November 28, and as *IOT207-R1* on December 2, at AWS re:Invent 2022.

The *Advanced Lab Modules* of the AWS re:Invent 2022 workshop used a Python library to quickly prototype an integration with AWS IoT ExpressLink using Python. The evolution of this early library is now available in this GitHub repository:
[awslabs/aws-iot-expresslink-library-python](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-iot-expresslink-library-python)

## Hardware Designs

The **AWS IoT ExpressLink Demo Badge hardware design**, with full schematics and PCB layout files, is available under the [hardware designs folder](./hardware-designs/).
